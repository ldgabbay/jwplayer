JW Player Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL)
====================================================

This license applies if you download a JW Player distribution or source code from www.longtailvideo.com or developer.longtailvideo.com.  Certain variations of the JW Player are also licensed under an open-source Create Commons license and a commercial license.  If you have not obtained, or the distribution does not directly specify, one of the other licenses, then the PUEL applies.

In summary, the JW Player PUEL allows you to use JW Player free of charge:

* for personal or educational use or, alternatively,
* for product evaluation.

If you do not belong to either category and would like to use the JW Player, then do not hesitate to contact LongTail Video in this matter.
