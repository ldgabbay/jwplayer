JW Player for HTML5
===================

The JW Player for HTML5 is a fully skinneable and configurable player based upon the new <video> tag found in HTML5. It is built using javascript (`jQuery <http://jquery.org'>`_) and skinned using PNG images, which makes it extremely easy to modify both the behaviour and looks. Since HTML5 support is currently not widespread, the player integrates a seamless fallback to the popular JW Player for Flash.
