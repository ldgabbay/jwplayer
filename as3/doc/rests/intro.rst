Introduction
============

The JW Player for Flash is the Internetâ€™s most popular and flexible media player. It supports playback of :ref:`any media type <media>` the `Adobe Flash Player <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/>`_ can handle, both by using simple downloads, :ref:`http` and :ref:`rtmp`.


The player supports various :ref:`playlist formats <playlists>` and a wide range of :ref:`options <options>` (flashvars) for changing its layout and behaviour. Embedding the player in a webpage :ref:`is a breeze <embed>`.


API
---

For javascript developers, the player features an extensive :ref:`API <api>`. With this API, it is possible to both control the player (e.g. pause it) and respond to playback changes (e.g. when the video has ended). 

API developers might find the :ref:`architecture` interesting as well; it describes in broad strokes how the player is architected and initialized on startup.


Addons
------

Both the layout and the behaviour of the player can be extended with a range of so-called addons. These addons are available on the `LongTail Video website <http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/>`_. There are two categories:

* **Skins** drastically change the looks of the player. A wide range of professional-looking skins `can be downloaded <http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/skins>`_.
* **Plugins** extend the functionality of the player, e.g. in the areas of analytics, advertising or viral sharing. Plugins are loaded from our plugin repository, making them extremely `easy to install <http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/plugins>`_.


It is possible to create your own skins and plugins using Adobe Flash and actionscript, but this is not covered by these documents. Instead, visit `developer.longtailvideo.com <http://developer.longtailvideo.com>`_ to learn more and download the various SDKs we offer.
