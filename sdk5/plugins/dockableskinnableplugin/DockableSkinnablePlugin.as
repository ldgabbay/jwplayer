	/** This is an example of a plugin that makes use of the dock and will take advantage
	 * of the currently loaded skin in determining it's appearance.
	 * 
	 * For this example we are making use of the Beelden skin which is included with the
	 * SDK. 
	 * 
	 * To take advantage of a skin, the skin must have the correct XML block 
	 * in the components section of its associated XML document.
	 * In the case of this skin, the XML would look like the following:
	 * 
	 * <component name="dockableskinnableplugin">
	 * 		<elements>
	 * 			<element name="dockIcon" src="skinicon.png"/>
	 * 		</elements>
	 * 	</component> 
	 * 
	 * In addition, in the skin directory you will need a folder named after your plugin
	 * which contains the image assets you wish to use.  You can find an example in the
	 * sdk5/skins/beelden/ directory.
	 * 
	 * For more information, please refer to the LongTail Video skinning guid at
	 * http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/wiki/Player5Skinning
