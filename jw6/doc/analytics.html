<h1>Using JW Player Analytics</h1>

<p>This guide explains how to enable and use the free JW Player analytics service. It is available in all JW6 editions, including <strong>Free</strong>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>JW6 offers a set of hosted services that augment the functionality of the client-side JW Player library. One of these services is JW Player Analytics, which provides basic video analytics to all users of JW Player. It is available for all users of JW Player, including those using the <strong>Free</strong> edition.</p>

<p>Video analytics can be found inside your <a href="http://longtailvideo.com/account">JW Player Account</a> (it also holds your download zip and license key). Analytics are automatically enabled when a valid license key is setup.</p>



<h2>Reports</h2>

<p>The <em>Analytics</em> section of your <a href="http://longtailvideo.com/account">JW Player Account</a> contains your analytics data. Two reports are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>The daily number of streams across all your JW Player embeds.</li>
<li>The total number of streams for each domain your JW Player is embedded in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a screenshot showing both reports, as well as a configurable start and end date for the reports:</p>

<p>Note that additional reports will be available in the near future.</p>



<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>JW Player Analytics are automatically enabled and matched to your account if you set your <strong>JW Player key</strong>. The key is found inside your <a href="http://longtailvideo.com/account">JW Player Dashboard</a>. It is set only once per page, just below the &lt;script&gt; that embeds the JW6 library:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/jwplayer/jwplayer.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;jwplayer.key="Ksio49Ksi8bdi8KS8S";&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Users of the <strong>Free</strong> edition can get a JW Player key by <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com">signing up and entering the dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Users of the Users of the <strong>Pro</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions will likely already have a key set, since the key is also used to unlock the additional features of each edition.</p>

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

<p>The global <strong>jwplayer.key</strong> setting is all you need to have video analytics appear in your account. However, two advanced configuration options are available to change the behavior of the JW Player Analytics. Both are set inside a configuration block called <strong>analytics</strong>:</p>

<dl><dt>cookies</dt><dd>
By default, JW Player uses cookies to track viewers across different pages on your site. This allows you to see e.g. the number of unique or returning viewers for your videos. Since tracking of cookies requires the explicit consent of viewers in the European Union, it is possible to disable cookie tracking by settings this option to <strong>false</strong>. Basic events (start, complete) will still be captured. 
</dd><dt>enabled</dt><dd>
The JW Player Analytics service is fast, comprehensive and available for free to all JW Player users. If you don't want to use this service though (for privacy reasons and/or if you have your own analytics), you can disable event tracking by setting this option to <strong>false</strong>. This setting is not available to users of the <strong>Free</strong> edition.
</dd></dl>

<p>Here is an example setup that disables cookies for all its viewers:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "/uploads/example.mp4",
    image: "/uploads/example.jpg",
    analytics: {
        cookies: false
    }
});
</pre>
