<h1>Browser &amp; Device Support</h1>

<p>JW Player is designed to support its full feature set on all popular browsers and devices. This page enumerates which browsers and devices are supported, including any existing limitations and differences between desktop and mobile.</p>

<p>Under the hood, JW Player is essentially two players (one in HTML5 and one in Flash) with a small wrapper that selects which to use. The selection process is described below.</p>



<h2>Desktop Browsers</h2>

<p>This table lists which desktop browsers are fully supported by JW Player, using HTML5 and/or Flash:</p>

<table><tr>
    <th>Browser</th><th>HTML5</th><th>Flash</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Chrome <sup>1</sup></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Firefox <sup>1</sup></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Internet Explorer 8</td><td>-</td><td>yes</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Internet Explorer 9</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Opera <sup>1</sup></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Safari <sup>1</sup></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td>
</tr></table>

<ol>
<li>New versions are frequently released. We always test the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">most widely used</a> one.</li>
</ol>

<p>All JW Player features are supported on these browsers, with the exception of media playback. In a nutshell, not all browsers support WebM video and Vorbis audio. See <a href="media.html">Supported Media Formats</a> for details.</p>

<p>One additional limitation is HTML5 Fullscreen support. Internet Explorer 9 does not (yet) support true fullscreen in HTML5. Instead, the <em>FullScreen</em> button in JW Player will enable full-browser-screen playback of the video.</p>



<h2>Mobile Devices</h2>

<p>This table lists which mobile devices are officially supported by JW Player, using HTML5:</p>

<table><tr>
    <th>Device</th><th>HTML5</th><th>Flash</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>iOS <sup>1</sup></td><td>yes</td><td>-</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Android 2.3</td><td>yes</td><td>-</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Android 4</td><td>yes</td><td>-</td>
</tr></table>

<ol>
<li>iOS devices are easily upgraded. We test iPhone &amp; iPad on the <a href="http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/">most widely used</a> iOS version.</li>
</ol>


<p>For many devices not on this list (e.g. <em>Android 2.2</em> or <em>BlackBerry 7</em>), JW Player will still provide users with an option to play the embedded audio or video file. Instead of a full-fledged player, a nicely formatted link to the file is then displayed. See <a href="#fallback">Download Fallback</a> for more info.</p>

<p>There's a few key differences in JW Player's approach to mobile devices compared to desktop browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>JW Player does not support Flash on mobile. Although Android devices may have Flash installed, the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/blog/25057/html5-takes-the-lead-on-android-devices">user experience is suboptimal</a>. Therefore, we focus 100% on HTML5.</il>
<li>JW Player uses video controls provided by the device. That way, the buttons work well using Touch (the default skin is optimized for Mouse). Device-specific enhancements will also remain available (e.g. <em>Airplay</em> and <em>pinch-to-fullscreen</em> on iPad).</li>
<li>On phones, video is only played in <em>fullscreen</em> mode. On tablets, video can be played either windowed or in fullscreen.</li>
<li>Changing the <em>mute</em> state and <em>volume</em> is not possible.</li>
<li>Auto-starting a video on page load is not possible.</li>
<li>Neither is playing more than 1 video at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with desktop browser, playback support for the various media formats varies. In an nutshell, MP4 video and AAC/MP3 audio are safe formats for mobile. See <a href="media.html">Supported Media Formats</a> for more details.</p>



<h2><a name="modes"></a>Mode Selection</h2>

<p>JW Player has two so-called <em>rendering modes</em>; two underlying browser technologies it can use to play a media format:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>HTML5</strong> &lt;video&gt; element. Available on most browsers and most devices.</li>
<li>The Adobe <strong>Flash</strong> plugin. Available on practically all browsers, but not on devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>All features of JW Player (playlists, skinning, scripting, etc.) are available in both rendering modes. Whether JW Player renders itself in Flash or HTML5 is therefore totally depending upon the media format(s) that is/are embedded. See <a href="media.html">Supported Media Formats</a> for details. Here's a quick overview:</p>

<ul>
<li>MP4, AAC, MP3 and HLS can be played in both HTML5 and Flash.</li>
<li>WebM and Vorbis can only be played in HTML5.</li>
<li>FLV, RTMP and YouTube can only be played in Flash.</li>
</ul>

<p>At large, the market moves away from Flash towards HTML5. Therefore, JW Player prefers to use HTML5 over Flash if a piece of content can be played in both modes on a certain browser. This behavior can be changed though, by setting the configuration option <strong>primary</strong> to <em>flash</em>. See <a href="embedding.html">Embedding the Player</a> for more info.</p>

<h3>Multiple Sources</h3>

<p>If an embed contains multiple media sources, JW Player will walk through all sources to select the first one that can be played in the <em>primary</em> mode. If none of the sources can be played, JW Player falls back to the secondary mode. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>With a setup containing MP4 + WebM sources and HTML5 primary, JW Player plays MP4 in HTML5 on Chrome, WebM in HTML5 on Firefox and MP4 in Flash on Internet Explorer 8.</li>
<li>With a setup containing RTMP + MP4 sources and HTML5 primary, JW Player plays MP4 in HTML5 on Chrome and RTMP in Flash on Firefox and Internet Explorer 8.</li>
<li>With a setup containing RTMP + MP4 sources and Flash primary, JW Player plays RTMP in Flash on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="playlists.html">Working with Playlists</a> to learn how to setup multiple sources.</p>

<p>If a playlist contains multiple items, JW Player will base its mode selection upon the first item. Any subsequent items that cannot play in that mode (e.g. FLV videos while the player selected HTML5) will get filtered from the playlist. Again, see <a href="playlists.html">Working with Playlists</a> for more info.</p>



<h2><a name="fallback"></a>Download Fallback</h2>

<p>In certain cases, neither Flash nor HTML5 mode can be used. For example, a visitor might use a BlackBerry phone, or attempt to watch a WebM-only video in Safari. In those cases, JW Player can render a so-called <strong>fallback</strong>. Which fallback is rendered is defined by the embedded media format:</p>

<ul>
<li>For MP4, AAC or MP3 files, a nicely formatted download link is rendered. The link consists of the poster image with a <em>play</em> button on top of it. When a visitor clicks the link, the device's built-in mediaplayer will play the file.</li>
<li>For YouTube streams, the plain YouTube <em>&lt;embed&gt;</em> code is inserted. This triggers a special-case embed of the YouTube player on iOS and Android devices. Videos will simply play inline, but the JW Player interface and API are not available.</li>
<li>For FLV, WebM and Vorbis files and RTMP or HLS streams, an <em>Unsupported Media Format</em> error message is displayed. This because these formats are likely not supported by built-in mediaplayers.</li>
<li>When using an <a href="playlists.html#rss">RSS Feed</a> instead of an inline playlist, the <em>Unsupported Media Format</em> message is also displayed. JW Player does not load and parse RSS feeds as part of the download fallback.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fallback option can also be disabled by setting the configuration option <strong>fallback</strong> to <em>false</em>. In that case, the original HTML is not touched by JW Player. This is useful for setting your own fallback message (e.g. a notification to install Flash). See <a href="embedding.html">Embedding the Player</a> for more info.</p>
