<h1>Building JW Player Skins</h1>

<p>This guide explains how to design and package a skin for JW Player. If you're looking for information on how to get and install existing skins, see <a href="skins.html">Using JW Player Skins</a>.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>JW Player skins change the appearance of the player, making it possible to match your video embeds to your site's aesthetic. No coding skills are required to build a skin, but proficiency with a graphics editor is (e.g. Photoshop or Illustrator).</p>

<p>Technically, a JW Player skin consists of an XML file that contains a number of settings (e.g. the <em>fontColor</em>) and a number of links to JPG or PNG images (e.g. for the <em>playButton</em>). These settings and elements are grouped into 5 components: Controlbar, Display, Dock, Playlist and Tooltip.</p>

<p>When a skin design is completed, the PNG images can be inlined into the XML file for faster loading. This is done by replacing the relative URLs to the PNG images with a base64 encoded version of the images. This technique is widely used for CSS style sheets as well.</p>

<p>Note the skinning model for JW Player was already available in version 5 of JW Player. However, several options were added, enhanced or removed. See <a href="5to6.html">Migrating from JW5 to JW6</a> for more info.</p>

<h3>Build versus Modify</h3>

<p>This guide and the accompanying <a href="skin-reference.html">Skin XML Reference</a> contain all info you need to design and package a JW Player skin from scratch. However, an existing skin may already satisfy 90% of your requirements. In that case, we recommend you simply modify an existing skin instead of building one from scratch:</p>

<ul>
<li>The developer site has a <a href="http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/browser/sdks">skinning SDK</a>, which includes the default JW5 and JW6 skins.</li>
<li>The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions of JW Player include 8 skins, which can be modified at will.</li>
</ul>

<p>Editing an existing skin also allows you to become proficient with the JW Player skinning model while avoiding beginner mistakes that may be hard to find.</p>



<h2>The Skin XML</h2>

<p>The skin XML document contains all the settings and all the (links to) images for your skin. The XML file is easy to create and edit with any text or HTML editor. Here's its overall structure:</p>

<pre>
&lt;skin target='6.0' name='SkinName' author='skinAuthor'&gt;
   &lt;components&gt;
      &lt;component name='controlbar'&gt;
         &lt;settings&gt;
            &lt;setting name='...' value='...' /&gt;
            ...
         &lt;/settings&gt;
         &lt;elements&gt;
            &lt;element name='...' src='...' /&gt;
            ...
         &lt;/elements&gt;
      &lt;/component&gt;
      ...
   &lt;/components&gt;
&lt;/skin&gt;
</pre>

<p>The main element, <strong>&lt;skin&gt;</strong>, declares that this XML is a JW Player skin. The <strong>target</strong> attribute declares this skin works in player 6.0 and up. The attribute is required for a skin to work in JW6! The additional <em>name</em> and <em>author</em> attributes are optional but useful metadata.</p>

<p>Inside the <em>&lt;skin&gt;</em> element, 5 <strong>&lt;component&gt;</strong> elements are placed, named <em>controlbar</em>, <em>display</em>, <em>dock</em>, <em>playlist</em> and <em>tooltip</em>. They correspond to the following visuals:</p>

<p><img src="assets/skinning-components.jpg" alt="A diagram of all JW Player skinning components" /></p>

<p>Each <em>&lt;component&gt;</em> contains two lists: one with settings and one with elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>&lt;setting&gt;</strong> refers to a non-image skinning option. Each setting contains a <em>name</em> (e.g. "fontsize") and a <em>value</em> (e.g. "12"). If a setting is omitted, the player reverts to the default value for that setting.</li>
<li>An <strong>&lt;element&gt;</strong> contains the url to a PNG, JPG or GIF image. Each element contains a <em>name</em> (e.g. "playIcon") and a <em>src</em> (e.g. "playIcon.png"). If an element is omitted, it is simply not displayed. This enables you to omit e.g. certain buttons from the controlbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Image elements must be stored in sub-directories that are named after the components. If, for example, inside the <strong>display</strong> component, you have set an element's <em>src</em> to "playIcon.png", the player presumes this image is at the following location:</p>

<pre>display/playIcon.png</pre>

<p>A full list of all supported settings and elements for each component can be found in the separate <a href="skin-reference.html">Skin XML Reference</a> guide. Here are shortcuts to the reference for the:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="skin-reference.html#controlbar">controlbar</a></li>
<li><a href="skin-reference.html#display">display</a></li>
<li><a href="skin-reference.html#dock">dock</a></li>
<li><a href="skin-reference.html#playlist">playlist</a></li>
<li><a href="skin-reference.html#tooltip">tooltip</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Testing a Skin</h2>

<p>Your XML document can simply be loaded into a JW Player using the <strong>skin</strong> configuration option. <a href="embedding.html">Embedding the Player</a> contains more info, but here's a basic setup block:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "video.mp4",
    height: 360,
    skin: "myCoolSkin/myCoolSkin.xml",
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Inside the <em>myCoolSkin</em> directory, you will have sub-directory containing all image assets. Make sure they all have the right name and read-all permissions:</p>

<pre>
myCoolSkin/controlbar/
myCoolSkin/display/
myCoolSkin/dock/
myCoolSkin/playlist/
myCoolSkin/tooltip/
</pre>

<p>Here's some additional hints for troubleshooting your skin-in-progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your XML file is malformed or not at the correct location, JW Player will display an error message.</li>
<li>XML and the JW Player are both case sensitive. Be sure your elements and file names are spelled correctly.</li>
<li>If you aren't sure which component or element is breaking your skin, you can add them in one-by-one until you discover what's wrong.</li>
<li>A good rule of thumb is to name the element filenames after the elements themselves (e.g.: the <em>playButton</em> element is mapped to <em>playButton.png</em>)</li>
</ul>



<h2>Packaging a Skin</h2>

<p>When your skin is completed, it is possible to package it, so distributing and loading the skin is much faster. Packaging is done by replacing the relative links to the PNG images with a base64 encoded string of the PNG image.</p>

<p>Creating base64 images of a skin is not trivial, though tools are available to do this for you. A simple tool is <a href="http://www.askapache.com/online-tools/base64-image-converter/">this free base64 image service</a>. More advanced, but harder to use tools (like <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>) can automate this for you.</p>
