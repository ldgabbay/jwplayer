<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>Getting JW Player up and running is now easier than ever. Only a few lines of HTML code are needed to embed a video that works on all popular desktop browsers and mobile devices. This guide walks through the necessary steps.</p>



<h2>1: Upload JW Player</h2>

<p>Before embedding a video, you must upload JW Player to your website. Unzip your player download and upload the <strong>jwplayer</strong> folder to the wwwroot of your website. The following three files should now be accessible over the internet:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>http://yoursite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.js</em> (the light-weight embed library)</li>
<li><em>http://yoursite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.html5.js</em> (the actual HTML5 player)</li>
<li><em>http://yoursite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.flash.swf</em> (the actual Flash player)</li>
</ul>

<p>The download of the <strong>Free</strong> edition is found <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/">on the JW6 product site</a>. Downloads of the <strong>Pro</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions are found <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/account/">in your account dashboard</a>.</p>



<h2>2: Include JW Player</h2>

<p>With the JW Player uploaded to your site, it now must be added to your code. Do this by linking <em>jwplayer.js</em> in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page:</p>

<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/jwplayer/jwplayer.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Since the embed library is light-weight, it's no problem to simply include JW Player with every page on your site.</p>

<p>Note you don't have to include the library in the &lt;head&gt; of your page, as long as it is included before an actual video is embedded.</p>

<h3>JW Player Key</h3>

<p>If you have a JW Player account key, set it in a second line of code right below the first one:</p>

<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;jwplayer.key="YOUR_JW_PLAYER_KEY";&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>The key enables tracking of <a href="analytics.html">video analytics</a> to your account. It also unlocks the <a href="about.html#editions">additional features</a> of the <strong>Pro</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions.</p>



<h2>3: Embed a Video</h2>

<p>With JW Player uploaded and included, it's now time to actually embed a video. Therefore, insert this HTML code at the location you want the video to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id="myElement"&gt;Loading the player...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "/uploads/example.mp4",
        image: "/uploads/example.jpg",
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this code, the &lt;div&gt; element is used as a container to load JW Player into. It must have a unique <em>id</em> attribute.</p>

<p>The setup() block defines which video <em>file</em> and poster <em>image</em> to load. Their URLs should be relative to the HTML page (just like embedding an images &lt;img&gt;).</p>



<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>That's it! With a few lines of code, you embedded a video that can be watched on any desktop browser, tablet or mobile phone. Next, JW Player supports many options for enhancing and tuning your embeds. Here are a few interesting guides:</p>
