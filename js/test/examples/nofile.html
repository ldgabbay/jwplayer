        <h1>No file path</h1>
		 <p>
           This page tests to see the players behavior when it is provided with no file path. Hitting play should leave the player in it's original state.
        </p>
		 <p>
           Players should appear in IE9, FF, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, but they will not play. IE < 9 will simply display "HTML5 Player should replace this".
        </p>

        	 HTML5 Player should replace this.
